# bda3-exercises

What you will find in this repository are my attempts to solve some (most?) of the excercises of the textbook [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Gelman et al.

I am studying the subject at my own pace and using python as programming language for anything involved.

**Remark**: This is not an official source by any mean, solutions may be error prone. Suggestions and corrections are always welcomed.

**Issues**: Some latex equations do not render on Github, while I have no issue on local machines. As before, suggestions are welcomed.
