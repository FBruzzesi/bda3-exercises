# bda3-exercises

What you will find in this repository are my attempts to solve some (most?) of the excercises of the textbook [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Gelman et al.

I am studying the subject at my own pace and using python as programming language for anything involved.

**Remark**: This is not an official source by any mean, solutions may be error prone. 

Suggestions and corrections are always welcomed.
